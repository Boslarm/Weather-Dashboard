# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate my understanding and implimentation of 3rd party APIs and the functions/getters of accessing information therein; by demonstrating either fetch, ajax methods. Moreover, this assignment demonstrates a dynamic HTML via JavaScript by creating elements on the page that is populated by data received via the API.

Also, our instructor asked us to use the City URL and display the data provided by API URL. UV index is not present in new free version of the API, and what we as a class are noticing, LAT and LON values are also not working in given URL
